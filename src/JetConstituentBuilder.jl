Build the collection of constituents (mapping jet -> reconstructed particles) for all jets in event.

Build the collection of constituents using cluster indices.

# Arguments
- reco_particles: a vector of `JetConstituents` representing reconstructed particles.
- indices: a vector of vectors, where each inner vector contains indices of particles for a specific cluster.

A vector of JetConstituents, each containing the constituents for a specific cluster.
