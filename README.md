# JetTaggingFCC

[![Build Status](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/JetTaggingFCC.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/JetTaggingFCC.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This package is developing jet tagging functionally for FCC.

**Important**: Currently it is necessary to use the pre-release of `JetReconstruction.jl` v1.0. To do this activate development for `JetReconstruction` in the usual way, viz.

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.develop("JetReconstruction")
```
